### 1. Repository Structure

### 2. Documentation Standards
- Use clear and concise language.
- Follow Markdown best practices:
    - Use `#` for headings.
    - Use `-` for unordered lists and `1.` for ordered lists.
    - Use backticks (`) for inline code and triple backticks for code blocks.
- Include examples and diagrams where applicable.

### 3. Configuration Guidelines
- Ensure all configurations are version-controlled.
- Use descriptive comments in configuration files.
- Validate configurations before committing.

### 4. Testing and Validation

- Document test cases and results in the `/docs/testing` directory.
